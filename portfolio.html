    <h2>1) Robot</h2>

      <img class="portphotos" src="assets/robot.JPG" width=300 px alt="This is an image of a small robot made from mostly metal beams. The side view of the robot is pictured, displaying a servo, gears, wires, and more."
        <br>

      <p> This is a robot that I helped to build with a few of my teammates in Mechatronics class a few months ago. We used Tetrix pieces and attactched things like motors and servos to the robot to allow it to move. We used a Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick to program the robot.  </p>
    <h2>2) Tic Tac Toe Program</h2>
    <img class="portphotos" src="assets/tictactoe.png" width = 1200 px alt="This is a screenshot of a program displaying the first few lines of code  and a console. In the console, Tic Tac Toe is drawn out in ASCII art, or art that is made from characters on a keyboard."
     <br>
      <p> This is a coding project that I completed with my classmate in AP Computer Science class this past year in which we created a working Tic Tac Toe game that users can play in the console. The program is written in Java and was completely written from scratch. </p>
